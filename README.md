Ludo is a board game that allows up to 4 players which originates from the Indian game Pachisi. Ludo provides an interesting problem from an AI perspective in that while its mostly a min-maxing technique to move one’s pieces in the most optimal manner, the other players’ involvement may sometimes not give ideal results. Then the key question would be - are there techniques better suited than a simple min-max approach? Can a random approach do equally good?

Such questions were analyzed during this project where some modern AI techniques were tested for their success rate at playing the game.
